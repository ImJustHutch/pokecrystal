# Pokémon Shining Crystal [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a hack of Pokémon Crystal.

My approach with hacks is to remove tedium and give the player as much choice & freedom as possible without changing too much of the game as a whole. I think the original Pokemon Crystal has a lot to offer, and I wanted it to shine through, hence the name.

This hack uses adjusted colors meant to look like how it would have on a GBC and is intended be viewed on a backlit screen (e.g. GBA SP, modded GBC, mGBA, etc.)
