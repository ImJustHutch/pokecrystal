# Pokémon Shining Crystal [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a hack of Pokémon Crystal.

My approach with hacks is to remove tedium and give the player as much choice & freedom as possible without changing too much of the game as a whole. I think the original Pokemon Crystal has a lot to offer, and I wanted it to shine through, hence the name.
