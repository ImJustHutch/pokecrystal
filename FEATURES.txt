My approach with hacks is to remove tedium and give the player as much choice & freedom as possible without changing too much of the game as a whole. I think the original Pokemon Crystal has a lot to offer, and I wanted it to shine through, hence the name.

General:
- All bugfixes outlined in docs/bugs_and_glitches.md have been implemented
- All uncensored/cut content restored from Japanese version
- Odd Egg now has 50/50 chance of giving a shiny like in Japanese version

QoL:
- No password needed to reset the clock (still hold Down + B + SEL)
- Much faster saving
- Prompt to reuse repels
- Lottery is daily instead of weekly
- Receive multiples of fruit from trees
- Kurt makes apricorn balls instantly
- Shorter low health beep
- Added Tradeback Guy to the Mobile Center (Gameboy kid closest to the door)

Moves n' stuff:
- TMs are reusable. Some have had their duplicates removed or have been relocated
- TM/HM names are shown in menus & when received
- HMs are forgettable (this means you can potentially softlock your game, but don't do that lol) [engine/pokemon/learn.asm & home/hm_moves.asm]
- Pokemon need only be able to learn a field move in order to use it
- The Move Deleter is now the Move Reminder. This implementation can teach moves of previous evolutions as well
- Goldenrod Move Tutor is free, available after clearing Radio Tower, and can teach endlessly

Battle:
- Twineedle can no longer poison Steel types; Tri Attack can no longer burn Fire types or freeze Ice types
- Removed the AI's extra 25% chance to miss status moves
- Text updated to differentiate between miss, fail, & protect

Aesthetics:
- Applied a BGB style color filter! Included program used to edit source pngs with instructions

Miscellaneous:
- Able to bike through the National Park gates!
- Improved outdoor sprite system
- Abra now holds Twistedspoon 2% of the time
