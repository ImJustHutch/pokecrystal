ADJUSTPLTE INSTRUCTIONS

adjustplte applies a series of color channel adjustments to the non-black, non-white palettes within pngs files. in the context of this hack, it is only used for pokemon & trainer sprites in gfx/pokemon & gfx/trainers respectively. the pngs in this branch have already been adjusted, but please feel free to use it for your own hack or polish the code or whatever.

to compile, open a CLI of your choice, navigate to the tools folder within the repo, and type "gcc adjustplte.c -o adjustplte". to apply the adjustments to the pokemon & trainer folders, you'd type:

./adjustplte ../gfx/pokemon
./adjustplte ../gfx/trainers

FYI, the program will recursively search through all subfolders within a directory.
